<p>For example, we have n random variables X<sub>1</sub>, X<sub>2</sub>, â€¦ X<sub>n</sub>, where E[X<sub>i</sub>]= \mu and the mean \mu is unknown. The average estimator is 
<script type="math/tex">\bar{X}=(1/n)\sum_{i=1}^{n}{X_i}</script>
How can we check if the estimator is biased? The bias of the estimator is how far the expected value of the estimator from the true \mu. In formula,
<script type="math/tex">Bias(\bar{X})=E[\bar{X}]-\mu</script>
If the bias value if zero, the estimator is said to be unbiased. The E(\bar{x}) can reflect that the \bar{X} is random. Because if several experiments are conducted, there could be different E[\bar{X}].</p>

<p>We can compute the expectation of \bar{X}.
<script type="math/tex">% <![CDATA[
\begin{split}
E[\bar{X}]&= E[(1/n)\sum_{i=1}^{n}{X_i}]\\
          &= (1/n)\sum_{i=1}^{n}{E[X_i]}\\
          &= 1/n\sum_{i=1}^{n}{\mu}\\
          &= (1/n)*n*\mu\\
          &= \mu
\end{split} %]]></script>
It means that the expected value estimator is unbiased because the Bias is 0.</p>
